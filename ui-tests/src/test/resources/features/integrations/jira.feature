# In order to run these test, it is first necessary to setup a jira docker container.
# This can be done using the following two commands:
#   docker volume create --name jiraVolume
#   docker run -v jiraVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira --name="jira" -d -p 8081:8080 atlassian/jira-software
#
# After that jira will be available on the localhost:8081 and need to be configured manually. Project should be a simple
# project, and it's key should be MTP (abbreviation for 'my test project' which i used initially). This key can be changed
# later, but for now it's this, being part of the tests.
#
# After that jira users must be created and it's necessary to obtain the oauth credentials using jira java application as
# shown in this article:
# https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.4/html/connecting_fuse_online_to_applications_and_services/connecting-to-jira_connectors#registering-with-jira_jira
#
# Only thing remaining now is adding credentials to credentials.json, which should be populated with oauth creds
# credentials example following:
#
# "Jira": {
#   "service": "Jira",
#   "properties": {
#     "jiraurl": "http://192.168.122.1:8081/",
#     "accesstoken": "OYAQSg3d3fG5v4NNEEwyhFShRqkattnr",
#     "consumerkey": "SyndesisApp",
#     "privatekey": "<...>",
#     "verificationcode": "RPkPo5"
#   }
# }
