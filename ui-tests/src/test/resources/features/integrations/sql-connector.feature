Feature: SQL Connector

  Background: Clean application state
    Given clean application state
    And log into the Syndesis
    And truncate "todo" table
    And navigate to the "Home" page

  #
  # 1. Check that SQL connector pulls all rows on exchange when SQL connector is as middle step
  # (having SQL connector as 'from' or 'to' doesn't cause issue from GH-3856)

  Scenario: Check SQL pulls all rows

    When insert into "todo" table
      | ABCsampleTODO |

      | KLMsampleTODO |

    And click on the "Create Integration" link to create a new integration
    Then check visibility of visual integration editor
    And check that position of connection to fill is "Start"

    # select Timer as 'from' point
    When select the "Timer" connection
    And select "Simple" integration action
    And fill in values by element data-testid
      | period        | 1       |
      | select-period | Minutes |
    And click on the "Next" button

    Then click on the "Next" button

    # select postgresDB as middle point
    When add integration step on position "0"
    And select the "PostgresDB" connection
    And select "Invoke SQL" integration action
    Then check "Next" button is "Disabled"

    # fill in postgresDB connection
    When fill in invoke query input with "SELECT * FROM  todo" value

    # save the integration with new name and publish it
    When click on the "Publish" link
    And set integration name "DB_2_Log"

    Then Integration "DB_2_Log" is present in integrations list
    And wait until integration "DB_2_Log" gets into "Running" state

    # validate that all items from db are present
    And wait until integration DB_2_Log processed at least 1 message

    Then validate that logs of integration "DB_2_Log" contains string "ABCsampleTODO"

    And fill in invoke query input with "SELECT id FROM todo WHERE <predicate>" value
    And click on the "Next" button

    # add data mapper
    And add integration step on position "0"
    And select "Data Mapper" integration step
    And sleep for 2 seconds
    And create data mapper mappings
      | id | id |
    And click on the "Done" button

    And click on the "Publish" link
    And set integration name "predicates-<name>"
    And publish integration
    Then Integration "predicates-<name>" is present in integrations list
    And wait until integration "predicates-<name>" gets into "Running" state
    And wait until integration predicates-<name> processed at least 1 message

    Then validate that logs of integration "predicates-<name>" contains items with IDs "<result>"

    # TODO: we might want to add more predicates, also function calls on either side etc

    Examples:
