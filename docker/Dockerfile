# Default version, for now, is 1.10.x, `docker build -t syndesisqe .`
# With the BUILD ARG, you can specify which version of Syndesis QE and Syndesis will be used in the final image
# e.g. `docker build -t syndesisqe --build-arg SYNDESIS_BRANCH_VERSION=1.10.x --build-arg SYNDESIS_QE_BRANCH_VERSION=1.10.x .`
# If you want to use your Syndesis/SyndesisQE fork during building, you can specify a build arg SYNDESIS_BRANCH_OWNER or SYNDESIS_QE_BRANCH_OWNER
# e.g. For building an image for testing changes in the code base which are committed only in the owner repo:
# `docker build -t syndesisqe --build-arg SYNDESIS_QE_BRANCH_VERSION=FUSEQE-9071_Containerizing-test-suite --build-arg SYNDESIS_QE_BRANCH_OWNER=mkralik3 .`


# You have to specify the cluster URL, NAMESPACE and admin credentials in the environment variables. When you don't specify tags, only the smoke test will be running.
# You can specify multiple test tags using cucumber notation via TAGS environment variable  like `-e TAGS='@smoke OR @database'`
# ! Be aware that the tests which use 3rd party services specified in credentials.json are not supported yet !
# The image contains only minimal credential.json in order to the tests which use self-deployed services work (AMQ broker, MongoDB).
## e.g.
#docker run \
#   -e URL='https://192.168.42.236:8443' \
#   -e ADMIN_USERNAME='admin' \
#   -e ADMIN_PASSWORD='admin' \
#   -e NAMESPACE='mkralik' \
#   syndesisqe
#
# For debugging, you have to expose port 5005
